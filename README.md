# Whack-a-Mole-Game
Welcome to Whack a Mole, a fun and interactive game that challenges your reflexes! The objective is simple: click (or "whack") the mole every time it pops up from a random hole before it disappears. The faster and more accurately you react, the higher your score!

How to Play:
1) Start the game by clicking the Start button.
2) Keep an eye on the holes — a mole will pop up randomly.
3) Click on the mole before it disappears to score a point.
4) Missed it? No worries — keep trying to beat your high score!
5) The game ends when the timer runs out.
